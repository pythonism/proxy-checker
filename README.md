# Proxy Checker

Simple **HTTP/HTTPS** proxy checker written with Python

# Usage

## Get started

First you need to get rid of problems with executing permissions, so to do that, open terminal and say:

```bash
chmod +x prox.py
```

### Check proxies from file

```bash
 ./prox.py -f <FILENAME>
```

### Check only one proxy

```bash
./prox.py -p <IP:PORT>
```
